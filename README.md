The goal of this project is to allow users to keep accurate records of inventory, manage and track expenses and store useful information in the supply chain. 

DUE TO THE CHALLENGE OF TIME, I was not eble to implement all features of the project. However, these features will are being worked on and are to be implemented in future. 


MISSING FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDE :

1. The website pages are not responsive. Due to the constraint of time, I wasn't able to make the website responsive. However, this is being worked on.

2. The project did not implement data presentation and analysis tools. I only used tables to display data. However, in future, there will be use of libraries like Matplotlib to display and present data in interpretive way.

3. Improveg design and the general appearance of the website.

4. More payment options and transaction processing interfaces. For instance, choosing a bank and a bank account no when one selects "Bank" during transaction processing.

5. Implementation of session handlers and context processors.

6. Warning for low stock levels or higher stock levels which may result in inventory associated costs such as holding costs incase of overstocking and stock outs in case of understocking. 

7. Order and re-order dates functions for individual items based on consumption and economies of scale.
